# framework for critical thinking

standard thought framework towards approaching most problems professionally and personally

**disclaimer**: this is my understanding at this point in time!

## context
- critical thinking is the **analysis** of available facts, evidence, observations, and arguments to form a judgement.
- rational, skeptical, and unbiased analysis or **evaluation of factual evidence**.
- requires **effective communication** and **problem-solving** abilities as well as a commitment to overcome native

## thought template

### problem statement definition
> we try to define the problem statement and identify its constraints

1. start with building a theory of the said problem statement
2. discover as many constraints as possible and classify them as mandatory and optional.
3. try discovering all stakeholders and their respective incentives in status quo
4. try discovering existing solutions previously applied or being currently utilized
5. identify if such solutions have any gaps or inefficiencies in context of your problem statement
6. define a success metrics that all possible solutions will be measured against

### solutions brainstorming
> we try to formulate and simulate several solutions that may solve our problem wholly or partly.

1. each solution needs to have benefits vs drawbacks outline
2. each solution should have it's complexity, effort and returns evaluated
3. preference between proposed solutions based on previous step. general rule is solutions which are simpler, have least effort and have maximum returns are preferred over those over others

### solution execution
> we break down our solution or plan into smaller steps, execute them parallelly or sequentially as applicable to reach our final goal

1. break down our plan into concise and simple steps for everyone executing to understand
2. delegation of tasks to owner depending upon strengths and weaknesses of stakeholder
3. expect respective task owners to provide time estimation, execution details, review and feedback mechanism
4. for additional redundancy, each task may have one or more backup tasks that need to be executed in succession
5. for arbitrarily risky solutions, further rollback or cut-loss solution have to be defined with same template to   
   mitigate risks as much as possible

## footnote
**Q: Where is this applicable?**

**A:** I don't see any roles per se where this thought template cannot be applied.

**Q: Does this come naturally to some or many?**

**A:** Nope, at least I don't believe so, this is too methodical for our random brains to have something out of the box

**Q: How do we develop this?**

**A:** one step at a time. try, make mistakes, go back and fix if possible. try again on the next attempt. on to next step. build it like a habit.

**Q: Is it tedious to practice?**

**A:** absolutely ðŸ˜…. Do also note that after your own formulation, we need to communicate this elaborate scheme to our **group** and later ensure delegation and execution is as close as possible to the plan.

**Q: Is it possible to get it right?**

**A:** Nope, at least I don't believe so again. everyone in our *group* have individuality and accordingly have different interpretation, coordination and execution style. aim is to get close not perfect. it'll always be a work-in-progress!

> Do note that in personal life, emotions are as important as incentives and we cannot measure emotions ðŸ˜…  
We don't want to reduce *people* to the term *stakeholder* and their *emotions* to *incentives*.
